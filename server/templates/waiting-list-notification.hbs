<p>Hey {{preferredNames}},</p>
<br/>
<p>You're on the waiting list for a place at DurHack {{currentEventYear}} ⏰.</p>
<p>We assign places on a first-come, first-served basis, so if our capacity increases
  or someone with a ticket lets us know they can't attend, you may be assigned a place.</p>
<p>We will notify you by email if so! 😎</p>
<br/>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>The DurHack Team</p>
