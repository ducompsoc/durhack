<p>Hi {{preferredNames}},</p>
<br/>
<p>We hope you’re excited for DurHack this weekend! </p>
<p>
    Registration opens 9:30-10:30am on Saturday 2nd. Please bring your <strong>ID</strong> and
    <strong>Student ID</strong> (if you have one).
    DurHack will be taking place at the <strong>Teaching and Learning Centre</strong>, South Road, Durham, DH1 3LS.
    <br/>
    We’ll be providing meals and lots of snacks for you over the weekend.
    However, if you wish to bring your own food, please don’t bring any snacks which contain <strong>peanuts</strong>
    or <strong>tree-nuts</strong>.
    <br/>
    This year, we will have a sleeping space on site, so if you wish to stay at the venue, you might want to bring a
    sleeping bag and pillow. For more info on what to bring, check out our Medium article
