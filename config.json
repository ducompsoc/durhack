We&#39;ll also provide loads of freebies, prizes, workshops and entertainment!"
    ],
    "Can I attend?": [
      "Anybody who is over 18 and a current registered student, or who has graduated after 23rd November 2018, can attend. Your degree subject doesn&#39;t matter, all you need is a passion for learning!",
      "DurHack is completely free to attend, and could not run without the generosity of our sponsors. We provide the space, WiFi, meals, snacks, and free swag."
    ],
    "Do I need to be able to code to attend DurHack?": [

      "If you want to learn to code but don&#39;t know where to start, you should definitely \n\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/on-coding/you-can-already-code-you-just-dont-know-it-yet-862044601a5a\">read this blogpost</a>\n\n.",
      "We&#39;ll also be running several lead-up workshops with \n\n<a href=\"https://compsoc.tech/\">CompSoc</a>\n\n to prepare people for DurHack."
    ],
    "Should I attend DurHack?": [
      "If you&#39;ve thought at all about attending DurHack, yes! DurHack is welcoming to people of all abilities, all that&#39;s important is a willingness to get stuck in with your team.

    ],
    "What can I eat?": [

    ],
    "What should I bring?": [

    ],
    "What if I don't have a team?": [
      "Don&#39;t worry! Part of the fun of a hackathon is meeting new people. We&#39;ll have a team-forming event before hacking begins for those who want to meet and form new teams."
    ],
    "Can I take a break overnight?": [
      "You&#39;ll have 24 hours to create your project. It&#39;s important to take regular breaks, and that&#39;s why we&#39;ll be providing a relaxation room for attendees to have a rest if they want. Part of the fun of the hackathon is coding through the night!"
    ],
    "What can I build and who owns the IP?": [
      "Web apps, mobile apps, hardware, anything! Projects will be judged based on their creativity, technical accomplishments, polish and usefulness by our judges.",

      "TL;DR: be respectful to each other."
    ],
    "Do you offer travel reimbursements?": [
