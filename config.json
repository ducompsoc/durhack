    ],
    "Can I attend?": [
      "Anybody who is over 18 and a current registered student, or who has graduated after 23rd November 2018, can attend. Your degree subject doesn&#39;t matter, all you need is a passion for learning!",

    ],
    "Should I attend DurHack?": [

    ],
    "What if I don't have a team?": [
      "Don&#39;t worry! Part of the fun of a hackathon is meeting new people. We&#39;ll have a team-forming event before hacking begins for those who want to meet and form new teams."
    ],
    "Can I take a break overnight?": [
      "You&#39;ll have 24 hours to create your project. It&#39;s important to take regular breaks, and that&#39;s why we&#39;ll be providing a relaxation room for attendees to have a rest if they want. Part of the fun of the hackathon is coding through the night!"
    ],
    "What can I build and who owns the IP?": [
