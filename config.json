    "What is DurHack 2019?": [
      "November 2019 marks the fourth iteration of DurHack, Durham University Computing Society&#39;s flagship annual hackathon. 150 students from Durham and around the country will come together in teams of up to five for a weekend-long invention marathon to create, innovate, learn and collaborate. We&#39;ll also provide loads of freebies, prizes, workshops and entertainment!"
    ],
    "Can I attend?": [
      "Anybody who is over 18 and a current registered student, or who has graduated after 23rd November 2018, can attend. Your degree subject doesn&#39;t matter, all you need is a passion for learning!",
      "DurHack is completely free to attend, and could not run without the generosity of our sponsors. We provide the space, WiFi, meals, snacks, and free swag."
    ],
    "Do I need to be able to code to attend DurHack?": [
      "The most important thing when attending a hackathon is your enthusiasm for technology. DurHack is passionate about being very welcoming and beginner-friendly, and you&#39;ll learn loads at the event!",
      "If you want to learn to code but don&#39;t know where to start, you should definitely \n\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/on-coding/you-can-already-code-you-just-dont-know-it-yet-862044601a5a\">read this blogpost</a>\n\n.",
      "We&#39;ll also be running several lead-up workshops with \n\n<a href=\"https://compsoc.tech/\">CompSoc</a>\n\n to prepare people for DurHack."
    ],
    "Should I attend DurHack?": [
      "If you&#39;ve thought at all about attending DurHack, yes! DurHack is welcoming to people of all abilities, all that&#39;s important is a willingness to get stuck in with your team. DurHack is designed to have an inclusive and encouraging environment, so don&#39;t be afraid to ask anyone for help at the event!"
    ],
    "What can I eat?": [
      "We&#39;ll provide you with meals, snacks and drinks throughout the weekend, leaving you to concentrate on your projects. If you have special dietary requirements, please let us know when you register."
    ],
    "What should I bring?": [
      "All attendees will need to show valid student ID (other photo ID is acceptable for graduates) at registration. You&#39;ll also need a laptop and a charger, and you might want to bring a sleeping bag and toiletries."
    ],
    "What if I don't have a team?": [
      "Don&#39;t worry! Part of the fun of a hackathon is meeting new people. We&#39;ll have a team-forming event before hacking begins for those who want to meet and form new teams."
    ],
    "Can I take a break overnight?": [
      "You&#39;ll have 24 hours to create your project. It&#39;s important to take regular breaks, and that&#39;s why we&#39;ll be providing a relaxation room for attendees to have a rest if they want. Part of the fun of the hackathon is coding through the night!"
    ],
    "What can I build and who owns the IP?": [
      "Web apps, mobile apps, hardware, anything! Projects will be judged based on their creativity, technical accomplishments, polish and usefulness by our judges.",

    ],
    "Do you have a code of conduct?": [
      "Everybody at DurHack 2019 will be expected to abide by the \n\n<a href=\"https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf\">MLH Code of Conduct</a>\n\n.",
      "TL;DR: be respectful to each other."
    ],
    "Do you offer travel reimbursements?": [
      "Yes! We know that hackers like you might be travelling from afar. We&#39;d love to see you at DurHack this year and welcome you to our community.
