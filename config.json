    "Should I attend DurHack?": [
      "If you&#39;ve thought at all about attending DurHack, yes! DurHack is welcoming to people of all abilities, all that&#39;s important is a willingness to get stuck in with your team. DurHack is designed to have an inclusive and encouraging environment, so don&#39;t be afraid to ask anyone for help at the event!",
      "DurHack is completely free to attend, and could not run without the generosity of our sponsors. We provide the space, WiFi, meals, snacks, and free swag."
    ],
    "Do I need to be able to code to attend DurHack?": [
      "The most important thing when attending a hackathon is your enthusiasm for technology. DurHack is passionate about being very welcoming and beginner-friendly, and you&#39;ll learn loads at the event!",
      "If you want to learn to code but don&#39;t know where to start, you should definitely \n\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/on-coding/you-can-already-code-you-just-dont-know-it-yet-862044601a5a\" target=\"_blank\">read this blogpost</a>\n\n.",
      "We&#39;ll also be running several lead-up workshops with \n\n<a href=\"https://compsoc.tech/\" target=\"_blank\">CompSoc</a>\n\n to prepare people for DurHack."
    ],
    "What about COVID-19?": [
      "We aim to make DurHack as safe as we possibly can, and DurHack will follow government and University guidelines. Presently, this requires showing evidence of a negative Lateral Flow Test result before the event, mandatory face coverings (unless medically exempt), and following the one-way systems at the venue.",
      "This guidance is always subject to change in the run up to the event, and so we will make COVID-19 information clear to all attendees closer to the time, and signposted at the event itself."
    ],
    "What can I eat?": [
      "We&#39;ll provide you with meals, snacks and drinks throughout the weekend, leaving you to concentrate on your projects. If you have special dietary requirements, please let us know when you register."
    ],
    "What should I bring?": [
      "All attendees will need to show valid student ID (other photo ID is acceptable for graduates) at registration. You&#39;ll also need a laptop and a charger, and you might want to bring toiletries.",
      "All students will be required to follow the COVID-19 guidance in place at the time of the event. Presently, this means that all students will need to provide evidence of a negative Lateral Flow Test result from a University testing site, taken within 24 hours before DurHack. We will email you more details closer to the event."
    ],
    "What if I don't have a team?": [
      "Don&#39;t worry! Part of the fun of a hackathon is meeting new people. We&#39;ll have a team-forming event before hacking begins for those who want to meet and form new teams."
    ],
    "How large can my team be?": [
      "There&#39;s absolutely no obligation for you to come to DurHack with a pre-made team. Many attendees won&#39;t, and we&#39;ll run team-forming exercises at the start to make sure everyone is part of an awesome team",
      "However, if you are already looking for teammates, we&#39;d recommend teams to have roughly 4 people in them, but a maximum of 5 people is allowed per team. Remember that, of course, each member of your team needs to have their own DurHack ticket."
    ],
    "Can I take a break overnight?": [
      "You&#39;ll have 24 hours to create your project. It&#39;s important to take regular breaks, and that&#39;s why we&#39;ll be providing a relaxation room for attendees to have a rest if they want. Part of the fun of the hackathon is coding through the night!"
    ],
    "What can I build and who owns the IP?": [
      "Web apps, mobile apps, hardware, anything! Projects will be judged based on their creativity, technical accomplishments, polish and usefulness by our judges.",
      "<strong>The IP of your work remains with you, the attendees.</strong>"
    ],
    "Do you have a code of conduct?": [
      "Everybody at DurHack will be expected to abide by the \n\n<a href=\"https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf\">MLH Code of Conduct</a>\n\n.",
      "TL;DR: be respectful to each other."
    ],
    "What if I have other questions?": [
      "If you&#39;re still not sure about something, drop us a line at \n\n<a href=\"mailto:hello@durhack.com\">hello@durhack.com</a>\n\n and we&#39;ll be very happy to help!"
