      "April 2020 marks our first Under 18 hackathon. 100 students from Durham and around the North East will come together in teams of up to five for a weekend-long invention marathon in order to create, innovate, learn, and collaborate. We&#39;ll also provide laptops, loads of freebies, prizes, workshops, and entertainment!"

    "What if I don't have a team?": [

    ],
    "How large can my team be?": [
      "There&#39;s absolutely no obligation for you to come to DurHack with a pre-made team. Many attendees won&#39;t, and we&#39;ll run team-forming exercises at the start to make sure everyone is part of an awesome team",
      "However, if you are already looking for teammates, we&#39;d recommend teams to have roughly 4 people in them, but a maximum of 5 people is allowed per team. Remember that, of course, each member of your team needs to have their own DurHack ticket."
    ],
